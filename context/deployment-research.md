# Ink-Rider deployment planning

Last reviewed: 2026-09-08

## Purpose

Deployment choices must support the application’s reliability, privacy, security, accessibility, and operating-cost requirements. Provider plans, pricing, and regional availability are time-sensitive and must be researched again before a purchase or production commitment.

## General deployment expectations

- Production uses independently deployable web, API, background-processing, persistence, and media-delivery responsibilities as the current architecture requires.
- Production release verification covers client routing, HTTPS, authentication, public metadata, background work, backups/recovery, observability, and performance at representative load.
- Preview and low-cost environments are useful for validation but are not evidence of production readiness.
- Capacity estimates are hypotheses until verified with workload and recovery testing.

## Release boundary

## Decision process

Before any deployment implementation, agree on provider, region, domain, budget, availability, recovery, and launch-scope expectations. Then validate the bounded application and infrastructure changes in the target environment. No research note is itself a deployment approval or production-readiness certification.
